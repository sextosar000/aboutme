    <h1>MY <em>FIRST</em> WEBPAGE</h1>

    <p>This p<sub>ara<sub>gra</sub>ph</sub> can <sup>be as l<sup>on</sup>g</sup> or as short as the heart desires. In the case of this webpage, it is rather long. I apologize if there are any eyes that suffer in light of this coding.</p>
     <br />
    <p>Apparently, GitHub was yelling at me about there not being any changes to commit. So therefore, I'm just adding a paragraph. Yeah.</p>
     <br />
    <p>But, <ins>as a matter of</ins><del>in</del> fact, there can be multiple paragraphs. As a fun fact, this is the greatest webpage ever created by this author. <mark>And the greatest in the <strong>world.</strong></mark></p>
